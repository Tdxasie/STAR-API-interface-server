# STAR API Exploration

A node server for a website to get data from the Services des Transports en commun de l'Agglom√©ration de Rennes

## Concept

The idea was to learn Node.js and how to work with APIs. Very beginner and full of mistakes and bad code.
Uses express.

## Finalization

The project was to emulate the official website and add real-time information (wich wasn't accessible at the time). So it was hosted on a raspberry pi with a custom domain name.
Never got to making a clean interface.
